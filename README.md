Source hosted at [GitHub](http://github.com/andrew/decommission).
Report Issues/Feature requests on [GitHub Issues](http://github.com/andrew/decommission/issues).

### Note on Patches/Pull Requests

 * Fork the project.
 * Make your feature addition or bug fix.
 * Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
   future version unintentionally.
 * Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
   (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
 * Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
